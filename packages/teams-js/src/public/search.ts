   * 
   * Your application should *not* re-render inside of these callbacks, there may be a large number
   * of onChangeHandler calls if the user is changing the searchQuery rapidly.
   *
   * @param onChangeHandler - This handler will be called when the user begins searching and every
   * time the user changes the contents of the query. The value of the query is the current term
   * the user is searching for. Should be used to put your application into whatever state is used
   * to handle searching. This handler will be called with an empty {@link SearchQuery.searchTerm}
   * when search is beginning. 
   * @param onClosedHandler - This handler will be called when the user finishes searching. Should be
   * used to return your application to its default, non-search state. The value of {@link SearchQuery.searchTerm}
   * will be whatever the last query was before ending search.
   * @param onExecuteHandler - This optional handler will be called whenever the user 'executes' the
   * search (by pressing enter for example). The value of {@link SearchQuery.searchTerm} is the current 
   * term the user is searching for. Should be used if your app wants to treat executing searches differently than responding
   * to changes to the search query.
   *
   * @example
   * ``` ts
   * search.registerHandlers(
      query => {
        console.log(`Update your application with the changed search query: ${query.searchTerm}`);
      },
      () => {
